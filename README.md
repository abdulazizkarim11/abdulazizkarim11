### Intro

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @abdulazizkarim11, I'm a Quality Assurance Tester with both Automation & Manual skills.
I help companies deliver high-quality products and services to their customers. 
You can say that testing is not just a job title to me but part of my life. I love to explore and understand the functionality of a product, ask questions and work as part of a team to achieve every impossible goal!
